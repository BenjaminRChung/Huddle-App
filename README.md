# Huddle Application

Huddle is a platform for like-minded developers to collaborate and build meaningful projects. It was built with the idea of finding passionate individuals with project ideas that were never fully realized. Huddle hosts a community of **350+ active developers** to build upon one another. Huddle was built because in my learning process to code, projects were of immense help. I had so many ideas, but seemingly never made the time to execute upon it. I figured this was a barrier many developers had faced. Originally hosted on Heroku, I'm currently working on the next iteration of this platform ~ new & exciting things to come :) 

### Tools used: TypeScript, SCSS, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, React
